Introduction
Many people during covidâ€™s quarantine lost some control over their lifestyle. 
For some, their diet got out of hand, others lost some of their fitness habits 
and for many, a short break from the gym ended up into a yearlong rest which 
led to a loss of muscle mass. This app is meant to help getting back into a 
routine and make keeping the routine easier. The user can choose how many 
days a week they can afford to spend on working out and what they hope to achieve,
and we will provide a workout plan that will allow for maintenance or bulking or 
toning in return. This app will also provide a recommended nutrition breakdown for
how the macros for a day should look based on the goal the user has chosen and 
suggest some recipes that can work for their day to save them time on choosing what to eat. 
The tracking feature will give the user a greater sense of responsibility towards themselves 
when they skip too many workouts, or cheat on their meal plan too often.
